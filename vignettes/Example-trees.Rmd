## Tree distance metrics

A number of metrics area available to quantify the similarity between two undirected
topologies (i.e. unrooted trees with no edge lengths).

### Partition metric
The Robinson-Foulds (RF, 'partition' or 'symmetric') [@Robinson1981] metric 
adds the number of bipartitions that are present in tree A (but not tree B)
to the number of bipartitions present in tree B (but not tree A).  

It is most useful when the trees to be compared are very similar; it has
a low range of integer values, limiting its ability to distinguish between
trees [@Steel1993].

### SPR metric
The subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) distance [@Penny1985] counts the 
number of SPR rearrangements necessary to transform Tree A into Tree B.

### Path difference metric
The length of a path from one tip to another in a tree is the number of edges
within the tree that must be crossed to navigate from one tip to the other.

Given two trees, is possible to calculate the difference in path length between
each pair of tips.

The path difference metric [@Steel1993] is the square root of the sum of squares
of each of these differences.

### Quartet metric
The quartet metric [@Estabrook1985] counts how many of the four-taxon statements 
that are true in Tree A are not true in Tree B.

For any four tips A, B, C and D, a bipartition on a bifurcating tree will separate
tip A and either B, C or D from the other two tips.  That is to say, removing
all other tips from the tree will leave one of the three trees

```{R Three four-taxon trees, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2, fig.width=6}
par(mfrow=c(1, 3), mar=c(0.5, 1, 0.5, 1), cex=1)
plot(ape::read.tree(text='((A, B), (C, D));'), tip.color=palette4[c(1, 2, 3, 4)], font=2)
plot(ape::read.tree(text='((A, C), (B, D));'), tip.color=palette4[c(1, 3, 2, 4)], font=2)
plot(ape::read.tree(text='((A, D), (C, B));'), tip.color=palette4[c(1, 4, 3, 2)], font=2)
```

There are `choose(n_tip, 4)` groups of four taxa in a tree with `n_tip` tips;
for each of these groups, one of the three trees above will be consistent with
a given tree.  As such, two identical trees will have a quartet distance of
0, and a random pair of trees will have an expected quartet distance of 
`choose(n_tip, 4) / 3`. Because quartets are not independent of one another,
no pair of trees with six or more tips can have a quartet distance of 
`choose(n_tip, 4)`.

```{R Plot a quartet, echo =FALSE}
#TODO!
PlotQuartet(x, y, z)
```

## Desired behaviour of tree distance metrics

The advantages of the Quartet distance [@Estabrook1985] over other tree distance
metrics [@Penny1985] are best illustrated by examining a set of example trees.

### Moving a single taxon

If trees differ only in the location of a single taxon, then the distance between
two trees should correspond to the distance that this taxon has been moved.

```{R Moving a single taxon, fig.height=3, fig.width=12, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 4), mar=rep(0.4, 4), cex=1)
colplot(ref_tree,     'Reference tree', 1)
rfplot(sq_trees$move_one_near, 'Short move', 1)
rfplot(sq_trees$move_one_mid, 'Medium move', 1)
rfplot(sq_trees$move_one_far,   'Long move', 1)
```

The subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) distance [@Penny1985] does not distinguish
between these trees, as they differ only in the placement of a single tip.
The Robinson-Foulds (RF, 'partition' or 'symmetric') [@Robinson1981],
path difference [@Steel1993] and quartet [@Estabrook1985] metrics, 
in contrast, recognize trees in which this tip has been 
moved further as more distant from the starting tree.

### Moving two taxa

Intuitively, moving a pair of tips on a tree should lead to higher tree distances
than moving a single tip.  In the case of a snort move, the RF distance
does not differ whether one or two tips are moved.
For larger moves, however, the RF distance is _less_ when two tips are moved than
when a single tip is moved.  The path and quartet metrics perform as expected.

```{R Moving a cherry, fig.height=8, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(3, 3), mar=c(2.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4), cex=1)

colplot(ref_tree, 'Reference tree')
rfplot(sq_trees$move_one_near, 'Short move 1', 1)
rfplot(sq_trees$move_two_near, 'Short move 2', 10:11)

colplot(ref_tree, 'Reference tree')
rfplot(sq_trees$move_one_mid, 'Medium move 1', 1)
rfplot(sq_trees$move_two_mid, 'Medium move 2', 10:11)

colplot(ref_tree, 'Reference tree')
rfplot(sq_trees$move_one_far,   'Long move 1', 1)
rfplot(sq_trees$move_two_far,   'Long move 2', 10:11)

```

### Maximum distance
A distance metric should distinguish slightly-peturbed trees from
random trees and those that are more different from the starting tree than 
expected by chance.

The worst-case scenario for the Robinson-Foulds metric involves the relocation
of a single taxon in a pectinate tree. As there are no partitions 
shared between the two trees, this situation generates the maximum
RF distance, and this trivially deformed tree is considered to be as distant
as a random tree.

```{R Pectinate to break RF, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 3), mar=rep(0.4, 4), cex=1)

pectinate_tree  <- ape::read.tree(text='(1, (2, (3, (4, (5, (6, (7, (8, (9, (10, 11))))))))));')
pectinate_unrooted <- ape::unroot(pectinate_tree)
pectinate_move1 <- ape::read.tree(text='(2, (3, (4, (5, (6, (7, (8, (9, (10, (11, 1))))))))));')
colplot(pectinate_tree, 'Pectinate tree')
rfplot(pectinate_move1,  'Move one taxon', 1, ref=pectinate_unrooted)
rfplot(sq_trees$random_tree,   'Random tree',   1, ref=pectinate_unrooted)
```

An advantage of the Quartet distance is that the normalized metric of a random
tree is $2/3$.  As such, trees that are more different than expected by chance
can be readily recognized, as their quartet distance will be greater than 
`r choose(n_tip, 4) * 2 / 3`/`r choose(n_tip, 4)`:

```{R Increasing distances, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 3), mar=rep(0.4, 4), cex=1)
colplot(ref_tree, 'Reference tree')
rfplot(sq_trees$random_tree,   'Random tree'     )
rfplot(sq_trees$opposite_tree, 'Maximum distance')
```

### Unresolved trees

Whereas the path distance and SPR metrics are only defined on bifurcating trees,
the quartet approach can be applied to trees that contain polytomies -- i.e. 
not every node is resolved as bifurcating.

An equivalent metric can be generated using paritions, but is subject to all the
same shortcomings as the RF distance discussed above.




```{R Polytomies - same topology, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 3), mar=c(0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4), cex=1)

colplot(ref_tree, 'Reference tree')
polyplot(sq_trees$collapse_one, 'One polytomy', 7:9)
polyplot(sq_trees$collapse_some, 'Much polytomy', 1:9)

```

In the above case, the underlying topology was unchanged.  We can also change
the topology -- here we have the same loss of resolution with the trees
in which one taxon (1) was moved:

```{R Polytomies 1, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 3), mar=c(0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4), cex=1)

polyplot(sq_trees$move_one_mid, 'One moved, no polytomy', 1)
polyplot(sq_trees$m1mid_col1, 'One moved, one polytomy', 1)
polyplot(sq_trees$m1mid_colsome, 'One moved, much polytomy', 1)

```

And here again, collapsing nodes in the trees
in which two taxa (10 & 11) were moved:

```{R Polytomies 2, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 3), mar=c(0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4), cex=1)

polyplot(sq_trees$move_two_mid,  'Two moved, no polytomy'  , 10:11)
polyplot(sq_trees$m2mid_col1,    'Two moved, one polytomy' , 10:11)
polyplot(sq_trees$m2mid_colsome, 'Two moved, much polytomy', 10:11)

```

## Plotting this data

We can visualise this data using a ternary diagram.

```{R Plot some trees, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
library('Ternary')
par(mfrow=c(1, 2), mar=rep(0.3, 4))
collapse_perfect <- c('ref_tree', 'collapse_one', 'collapse_some')
collapse_move1   <- c('move_one_mid', 'm1mid_col1', 'm1mid_colsome')
collapse_move2   <- c('move_two_mid', 'm2mid_col1', 'm2mid_colsome')

TernaryPlot(' Consistent', ' Contradicted', 'Unresolved', lab.cex=0.8, lab.font=2,
            grid.lty='solid', col=rgb(0.9, 0.9, 0.9), grid.col='white', 
            axis.col=rgb(0.6, 0.6, 0.6), ticks.col=rgb(0.6, 0.6, 0.6),
            padding=0.1)
title(main="\r\nQuartet distances", cex.main=0.8)
HorizontalGrid()

AddToTernary(points, QuartetPoints(trees))


# TernaryGrid +
# geom_point(data=QuartetPoints(trees), color=rgb(0.3, 0.2, 0.5), shape=3, size=3) +
# ggtitle(paste0("Quartets:"))
# 
# 
# TernaryGrid +
# geom_point(data=SplitsPoints(trees), color=rgb(0.3, 0.2, 0.5), shape=3, size=3) +
# ggtitle(paste0("Partitions:"))
```


## Conclusion

The quartet distance is the only available metric of tree distance that fullfils 
all of the following desiderata:

 - Allocates trees higher distances if a clade moves greater distances
 - Allocates trees higher distances if a the clade that is moved is larger
 - Distinguishes contradicted from unresolved information in trees that 
   are not fully bifurcating (resolved)
 - Identifies pairs of trees that are more random than expected by chance
 - Does not reach its maximum value after relatively trivial rearrangements
